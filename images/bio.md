### [Buddy.ai](https://buddy.ai/en)

**Product Designer**
*Jun 2022 – present*

Buddy is a voice-based virtual English tutor for kids.

### [Finolog](https://finolog.ru/)
**Art-director & Designer**
*Mar 2016 – Jan 2022 (5 yrs 11 mos)*

Finolog is an accounting service for small businesses. It aggregates all the money flows in one place and predicts cash gaps. It automatically loads transactions from bank accounts and shows the complete financial picture of the business.

I was the sole designer in the early stages of the company. We worked as a tiny team, so responsibilities were wide. I did: product design, promo and landing pages, and some front-end development. I wrote the first set of articles in our help center — there wasn't customer support as a separate department.

Later I started working on onboarding. I interviewed customers who recently converted and made several conclusions about why they bought our product and outlined users' goals. Then, with our junior designer, we created onboarding guides. We used Intercom's "Product Tours" to deliver these guides to users.

### [Megaplan](https://megaplan.ru/)
Megaplan is a CRM and task and project management software. It's one of the leading SaaS in the Russian market.

**Lead Designer**
*Nov 2014 – Mar 2016 (1 yr 5 mos)*

I have finished the design of the new Megaplan mobile app, which was started by the previous lead designer.

Hired two designers at the company.

Before leaving, I drew a design concept for the evolution of Megaplan, which formed the basis for the current design of the service.

**Product Designer**
*Jan 2012 – Nov 2014 (2 yrs 11 mos)*

Initially, I worked on the redesign of the CRM. Within a year we launched a new UI for Clients and Deals modules.

Then I moved to a team working on Zettaplan (initially Megaplan 2) — which is an attempt to create a modern, streamlined version of Megaplan. It focuses on contextual communication and has an Inbox that allows users to view notifications and reply to them like in an email app. But instead of letters inbox shows you tasks, discussions, projects, and clients. Zettaplan helps to organize a company's tasks, projects, and communication. It also has a personal planner and calendar.
